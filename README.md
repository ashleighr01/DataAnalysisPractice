# DataAnalysisPractice

Information for a high school students who are interested in attending college following high school graduation. This data was tracked in November to review where they applied, where they were accepted, what they will major in, if their FAFSA was completed, and if they applied for scholarships. 

Pieces to note: responses did not a uniform rubric (yes or no's only), some responses have since changed since the data was taken.
